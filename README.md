2022 Fall Theory of computation final project by F74096352 ÂºµËÇ≤Á∂≠

Story
---
The FIFA 2022 World Cup came to an end on December 18. As a football enthusiast, I watched pretty much all of the games with some friends. We also spent some money on buying sport lottery but always ended up losing.

A wise Chinese man once said: **"Â∞èË≥≠ÊÄ°ÊÉÖÔºåÂ§ßË≥≠ÈÉ≠Âè∞Èäò"**.

This means spending a little bit of money on lottery is fun, but spending a lot of money on it can make you become Gu≈ç T√°im√≠ng(ÈÉ≠Âè∞Èäò), whom is very rich.

I hope to be like Gu≈ç T√°im√≠ng in the future, so I made this Line bot to help me achieve the dream.
